            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student at the University of Auckland with a passion for building web applications and exploring new technologies. I enjoy experimenting with Java and Python, as well as developing full-stack web apps that solve real-world problems. Throughout my studies and personal projects, I have developed strong problem-solving and teamwork skills—whether tackling challenges solo, collaborating with classmates, or participating in hackathons.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests span across software development, artificial intelligence, and the latest trends in web technologies. I love exploring new frameworks and tools, and I’m constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. From creating interactive websites to automating workflows, I strive to make my work both functional and impactful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals, staying active in tech communities, and drawing inspiration from innovative projects around the world. I’m always excited to take on new challenges, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue my journey of growth in the world of technology.
